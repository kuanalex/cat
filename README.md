# cat

This is a very simple program that demonstrates how to fetch data from an API

In this demo I've fetched the URLs of random cat gifs from Giphy and displayed them on a page.

I learned about APIs, API documentation, how to fetch data using the fetch() method, how to get an API key, API endpoints, and how to customize my API query to get the information I want.
